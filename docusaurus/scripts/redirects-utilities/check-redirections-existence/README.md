# Docusaurus Redirect Checker Script

A Node.js script that helps you identify URLs in your Docusaurus documentation that don't have corresponding redirects configured.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- A Docusaurus project
- The `all-urls.txt` file generated by the URL extraction script
- A `docusaurus.config.js` file with (or without) existing redirects

## Installation

1. Copy the `check-redirects.js` file into your `scripts` folder, alongside the URL extraction script.

## Usage

1. Make sure you've run the URL extraction script first:
```bash
node scripts/all-urls-extractor/extract-urls.js
```

2. Run the redirect checker:
```bash
node scripts/redirects-utilities/check-redirections-existence/check-redirects.js
```

The script will output:
- Total number of URLs found
- Total number of existing redirects
- List of URLs without redirects
- A ready-to-use redirect configuration template

Example output:
```
Found 150 URLs and 45 redirects

Found 105 URLs without redirects:

  /docs/intro#getting-started
  /docs/advanced#configuration
  ...

Suggested redirect configuration:

module.exports = {
  redirects: [
    {
      from: '/docs/intro#getting-started',
      to: '/docs/intro#getting-started',  // TODO: Update with correct destination
    },
    ...
  ],
};
```

## How it Works

The script:
1. Reads the `all-urls.txt` file generated by the URL extraction script
2. Loads your `docusaurus.config.js` and extracts existing redirects
3. Compares both lists to find URLs without redirects
4. Generates a configuration template you can use in your `docusaurus.config.js`

## Redirect Configuration

The script supports both redirect formats from Docusaurus:

```js
// Object format
{
  from: '/old-path',
  to: '/new-path',
}

// Array format
['/old-path', '/new-path']

// Multiple 'from' paths
{
  from: ['/old-path', '/another-old-path'],
  to: '/new-path',
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get any errors, check that:
1. You've run the URL extraction script first
2. Both scripts are in the `scripts/` folder
3. Your `docusaurus.config.js` file exists and is valid
4. You're running the script from the root of your Docusaurus project
